# Fifa_Data_Analysis
Analysing the data of the game Fifa 22 and it's previous releases

here i have uploaded the main code. i have not specified the address as it's upto the user to change it.
also this code can be used to analyse the data from previous releases. fifa 16,17,18,19,20,21,22.
i will be uploading the data for fifa 23 once it's released.
the best thing about this data is that you can see how the players are growing, how the demands in wages are growing.
also you can see how every year the best players in the game changes except messi ronaldo and neymar.
enjoy playing! enjoy coding!
